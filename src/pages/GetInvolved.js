              <p>
                Judges are essential to hosting a successful UPenn EcoVenture competition. By
                serving as a judge, you'll empower student entrepreneurs to bring their ideas to
                life.
              </p>
              <p>Reach out to prizepcv@gmail.com if you are interested in becoming a judge or mentor for next year's competition. We are recruiting judges for each of the three rounds: written application, slide
              deck, and live pitch judging.</p>
